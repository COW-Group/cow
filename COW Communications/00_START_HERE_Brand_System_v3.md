---

### Step 2: Set Up Your Tools (1-2 hours)

**For Designers:**

1. **Update Figma/Sketch:**

   - Create components for both modes
   - Set up color styles with naming: `[mode]/[category]/[name]`
   
2. **Add CSS Variables:**
   ```css
   /* Copy from Color Palette Quick Reference */
   :root[data-theme="dark"] { ... }
   :root[data-theme="light"] { ... }
   ```

3. **Create Mode Toggle:**
   ```javascript
   /* Copy from Luminance Layers Quick Guide */
   const toggleTheme = () => { ... }
   ```

**For Developers:**

1. **Implement CSS Variables** (Color Palette Quick Reference)
2. **Add Mode Detection** (Luminance Layers Quick Guide)
3. **Test Mode Switching** (Both modes work, smooth transitions)

**For Content Creators:**

1. **Bookmark AI Prompts** (Ink Painting Guide)
2. **Generate Test Illustration** (Try dark mode hero)
3. **Review Quality Standards** (Professional checklist)

---

### Step 3: Create Your First Dark Mode Page (2-4 hours)

**Start with Homepage:**

1. **Hero Section:**
   ```css
   background: linear-gradient(180deg, 
     #020617 0%, 
     #0f172a 50%, 
     #020617 100%
   );
   ```

2. **Generate Hero Illustration:**
   - Use prompt from Ink Painting Guide
   - Create both dark and light versions
   - Test visibility on backgrounds

3. **Update Text Colors:**
   - Primary: #f8fafc (dark) / #0f172a (light)
   - Secondary: #cbd5e1 (dark) / #475569 (light)

4. **Add CTAs:**
   - Background: #2563eb (Electric Blue - both modes)
   - Test hover states

5. **Include Earth-Tone Warmth:**
   - Footer with Warm Stone (#9B8B7E)
   - Or warm section backgrounds

6. **Test:**
   - Toggle between modes
   - Check text contrast (WCAG AAA)
   - Verify illustrations visible
   - Ensure smooth transitions

## Common Questions

### "Do I need to update everything immediately?"

**No.** Follow this priority:

**Phase 1 (Week 1):**
- Homepage
- Product pages
- Signup/login flows

**Phase 2 (Weeks 2-4):**
- Research center
- Blog
- Help documentation

**Phase 3 (Months 2-3):**
- Everything else
- Internal tools last

---

### "What's the difference between Cerulean and Electric Blue?"

**Cerulean** (#007BA7 / #00A5CF):
- Brand identity (logo, headers)
- Key brand features
- Brand recognition

**Electric Blue** (#2563eb):
- User actions (buttons, links)
- Interactive elements
- Primary CTAs

**Rule:** Use Electric Blue for actions, Cerulean for brand.

---

### "How much earth tone should I use?"

**Dark Mode:** 10-15% of composition  
**Light Mode:** 20-30% of composition

**Examples:**
- Footer sections
- Card bottom borders
- Warm background sections
- Dividers and accents

**Don't go below 10% or you'll lose warmth.**

---

### "Can I skip dark mode for some pages?"

**Not recommended**, but if you must:
- Document which pages are light-only
- Add "Light mode only" notice
- Plan to add dark mode later
- Test in light mode meticulously

**Better:** Implement both modes from start.

---

### "What if AI illustrations aren't good enough?"

**Options:**
1. Iterate prompts (try 5-10 variations)
2. Post-process in Photoshop/Figma
3. Try different AI tools (Grok vs Midjourney)
4. Commission custom for hero images

**Standard:** Must be professional and on-brand. Don't compromise quality.

---

### "Do I need both dark and light illustration versions?"

**Yes, for best results.**

**Why:**
- Dark mode needs lighter values (visibility)
- Light mode needs darker values (contrast)
- Glow effects work differently
- Earth tone percentages differ

**Shortcut:** Generate light mode first, then ask AI to "optimize this for dark navy background #0f172a"

## Key Principles to Remember

### 1. Luminance Hierarchy First
**Ask:** "Is the hierarchy clear in 3 seconds?"
- Most important = most prominent/bright
- Clear primary ‚Üí secondary ‚Üí tertiary

### 2. Warmth Always
**Include:** 10-15% earth tones (dark) / 20-30% (light)
- Prevents cold, clinical feeling
- Adds human touch
- Brand warmth

### 3. Both Modes Matter
**Test:** Every design in both contexts
- Dark mode for late-night users
- Light mode for daytime users
- Respect user preference

### 4. Accessibility Non-Negotiable
**Standard:** WCAG AAA (7:1 ratio minimum)
- Clear contrast always
- Keyboard navigable
- Screen reader friendly

### 5. Professional Quality Bar
**Maintain:** Enterprise-level sophistication
- Not playful or casual
- Financial services appropriate
- Anthropic/Stripe quality

## What Makes This Different

### From "Horizon" to "Luminance Layers"

**Old Principle:** "Cerulean sky meets Earth ground"
- Great metaphor, but didn't work in dark mode
- Literal interpretation limiting
- Focused on specific color relationship

**New Principle:** "Clear hierarchy through luminance"
- Works in dark AND light modes
- Focuses on information clarity
- More flexible application
- Same warmth, better system

**What Stayed the Same:**
- Earth tones still essential ‚úÖ
- Generous negative space ‚úÖ
- Professional minimalism ‚úÖ
- Cerulean brand identity ‚úÖ

**What's Better:**
- Dark mode natural fit ‚úÖ
- Universal application ‚úÖ
- Clearer testing framework ‚úÖ
- More professional language ‚úÖ

## Timeline Expectations

### Realistic Implementation:

**Week 1:** Foundation (CSS, toggle, tools)  
**Week 2:** Homepage completed  
**Week 3:** Main pages updated  
**Week 4:** Polish and launch  

**Month 2:** Medium-priority pages  
**Month 3:** Complete rollout  

**Total:** 3 months to full implementation

**Don't rush.** Quality over speed.
