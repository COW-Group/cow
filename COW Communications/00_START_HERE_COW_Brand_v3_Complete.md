## üé® The Visual System: Sumi-e Sky + Earth

### Core Philosophy: "Where Cyan Sky Meets Earth, Life Grows"

**Inspiration:** East Asian ink painting (sumi-e) + natural elements + zen minimalism

**The Horizon Principle (RESTORED!):**
Every design shows the relationship between:
- **Cyan Sky/Water** (#00A5CF, #0ea5e9, #38bdf8) = Aspiration, innovation, flow
- **Earth Tones** (#9B8B7E, #C9B8A8, #C77A58) = Foundation, stability, warmth  
- **Life/Growth** (#6B8E6F bamboo, #10b981 emerald) = Vitality between sky and earth

**Never** cyan floating alone. **Always** sky meets earth. **Always** grounded.

**Three Layers:**
1. **Atmospheric** (Lightest) - Backgrounds, breathing room, zen space (60-70%)
2. **Structural** (Medium) - Cards, containers, horizon moments (20-30%)
3. **Emphasis** (Densest) - CTAs, key elements, vital focus (5-10%)

**Why This Works:**
- Professional (cyan ink tradition) + Warm (earth tones) = Complete
- Modern (dark mode) + Timeless (sumi-e art) = Distinctive
- Zen (minimalism, space) + Vital (bamboo, emerald) = Balanced
- Cool + Warm = Temperature harmony
- Philosophy + Beauty = Meaning

```css
.hero-dark {
  background: linear-gradient(
    to bottom,
    #020617 0%,
    #0f172a 50%,
    #020617 100%
  );
  min-height: 100vh;
}
```

**2. Color System Implementation** ‚ö°
Install the new color system in your design tools and codebase. This enables everything else.

**3. Component Library Update** ‚ö°

## üé® Using the New System

### Quick Decision Tree

```
Creating something new?
    ‚Üì
Which mode are you designing for?
    ‚Üì
‚îú‚îÄ Light Mode
‚îÇ   ‚Ä¢ Background: White (#ffffff)
‚îÇ   ‚Ä¢ Primary: Deep Blue (#1e40af)
‚îÇ   ‚Ä¢ Accent: Accent Blue (#2563eb)
‚îÇ   ‚Ä¢ Success: Emerald (#059669)
‚îÇ   ‚Ä¢ Text: Black Ink (#0f172a)
‚îÇ
‚îî‚îÄ Dark Mode
    ‚Ä¢ Background: Deep (#020617)
    ‚Ä¢ Primary: Bright Blue (#3b82f6)
    ‚Ä¢ Accent: Light Blue (#60a5fa)
    ‚Ä¢ Success: Bright Emerald (#10b981)
    ‚Ä¢ Text: White (#f8fafc)

Apply Ink Density Principle:
‚Ä¢ 60-70% Atmospheric (backgrounds)
‚Ä¢ 20-30% Structural (containers)
‚Ä¢ 5-10% Emphasis (CTAs, key elements)

Test in both modes before launching!
```

---

## üìê Design Principles

### The Three Core Principles:

**1. Ink Density**
Create hierarchy through density, not just size. Light washes for atmosphere, concentrated strokes for emphasis.

**2. Mode Equality**
Both light and dark modes should feel equally polished and intentional. Don't treat dark mode as an afterthought.

**3. Strategic Color**
Use color purposefully. Blue for brand identity, emerald for vitality/success, gold for premium moments. Never random colors.

---

## üö® Common Mistakes to Avoid

### ‚ùå Don't:
1. Use colors not in the palette
2. Design only for light mode
3. Forget to test contrast
4. Ignore the ink density principle
5. Use the old horizon principle
6. Create dark mode by just inverting colors
7. Overuse bright colors in dark mode
8. Under-use white/dark space

### ‚úÖ Do:
1. Use official brand colors only
2. Design for both modes simultaneously
3. Check contrast ratios (WCAG AA minimum)
4. Follow the three-layer ink density system
5. Embrace the ink flow aesthetic
6. Carefully design dark mode from scratch
7. Use luminous colors strategically
8. Give content room to breathe (60%+ white/dark space)

---

## üìä Success Metrics

### How to Know It's Working:

**Brand Consistency:**
- [ ] All new designs use brand colors correctly
- [ ] Both modes look equally polished
