---

## ‚ùì Common Questions Answered

### "Do I really need earth tones in EVERY design?"

**Yes.** At minimum 20% of composition.

**Why:** Without earth grounding, cerulean floats. Floating = ungrounded, unrealistic, cold.

**Solution:** Footer, background section, base element, or accent‚Äîjust make earth visible.

---

### "Can I use a different blue?"

**No.** Cerulean (#007BA7 family) is your brand signature.

**Why:** Other blues are used by everyone. Cerulean + earth = distinctive COW.

---

### "What if my design is mostly text?"

**Solution:** Ground the text container.
- Rice paper background (#F5F3F0) = earth tone ‚úì
- Warm stone footer or divider = earth tone ‚úì
- Cerulean headers or links = cerulean present ‚úì

---

### "Does this apply to emails?"

**Yes!** Every touchpoint.

**Quick email structure:**
- Header: Cerulean (sky)
- Body: White or rice paper (neutral)
- Footer: Warm stone section (earth)
