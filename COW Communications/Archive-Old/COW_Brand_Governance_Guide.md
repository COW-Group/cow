# COW Group Brand Governance Guide

## Purpose

This guide ensures brand consistency, quality, and integrity as COW Group grows. It establishes who makes brand decisions, how to maintain standards, and how to evolve the brand thoughtfully.

## Brand Stewardship Principles

### 1. Brand as Shared Responsibility

**Everyone** at COW Group is a brand steward, but with different levels of authority:

- **Leadership:** Sets brand strategy and vision
- **Brand Team:** Maintains standards and guidelines
- **All Employees:** Represent the brand in every interaction
- **Partners:** Extend the brand with our guidance

### 2. Consistency with Flexibility

**Consistent:**
- Core visual identity (logo, colors, typography)
- Voice attributes (rigorous, warm, clear, inviting)
- Values demonstration (never stated, always shown)
- Quality standards (research-backed, user-centric)

**Flexible:**
- Tone (adapted to context)
- Content formats (evolving with platforms)
- Design applications (creative within system)
- Market positioning (refined with learning)

### 3. Evolution Over Revolution

Brand changes should be:
- **Intentional:** Based on data and strategy, not whims
- **Gradual:** Test, learn, adjust
- **Documented:** Updates to guides and systems
- **Communicated:** Team understands changes and rationale
