---

## Writing Guidelines

### Sentence Structure

**Keep sentences short and clear:**
- Average 15-20 words per sentence
- One idea per sentence
- Vary length for rhythm
- Break up long paragraphs

**Example:**

‚ùå **Too Long:**
"We've developed an algorithmic optimization framework that leverages machine learning and real-time market data to dynamically rebalance portfolios across multiple asset classes while maintaining regulatory compliance and minimizing transaction costs."

‚úÖ **Better:**
"Our algorithms optimize portfolios in real-time using machine learning and market data. They rebalance across asset classes while staying compliant and minimizing costs."

---

### Word Choice

**Use simple, precise words:**

| Instead of | Use |
|------------|-----|
| Utilize | Use |
| Facilitate | Enable, help |
| Implement | Do, build |
| Leverage | Use |
| Paradigm | Model, approach |
| Synergy | Combination |
| Stakeholders | Investors, users, people |
| Solutions | Products, programs |
| Ecosystem | System, network |

**But keep technical terms when appropriate:**
- Algorithmic optimization ‚úì
- Risk-adjusted returns ‚úì
- Multi-jurisdictional compliance ‚úì
- Tokenomics ‚úì

Define terms on first use if not common knowledge.

---

### Active vs. Passive Voice

**Prefer active voice:**

‚ùå Passive: "Performance improvements were observed in optimized portfolios."
‚úÖ Active: "Optimized portfolios showed performance improvements."

**Passive is okay when:**
- Focus is on the action, not the actor
- Actor is unknown or unimportant
- In academic/research writing conventions

---

### First, Second, Third Person

**Default to second person for direct communication:**
- "You can access..." (not "Users can access...")
- "Your portfolio..." (not "The portfolio...")

**Use first person for brand voice:**
- "We're building..." (not "COW Group is building...")
- "Our research shows..." (not "The research shows...")

**Use third person in research:**
- "This study examines..."
- "The data suggests..."

---

### Numbers & Data

**Make numbers scannable:**
- Use numerals, not words (12, not twelve)
- Add commas for thousands (1,000 not 1000)
- Use % symbol (25% not 25 percent)
- Round appropriately (4.6% not 4.6284%)

**Provide context:**

‚ùå "8.2% alpha generation"
‚úÖ "8.2% additional annual returns compared to passive holdings"

**Use data visualizations when possible:**
- Charts for trends
- Tables for comparisons
- Infographics for processes

---

## Common Scenarios

### Announcing Research

**Structure:**
1. Lead with the finding
2. Explain the significance
3. Link to full paper
4. Invite discussion

**Example:**
"New research: Algorithmic asset optimization delivers 4.6-8.2% additional annual returns across 400,000+ wallets in 23 jurisdictions.

This suggests that smart contract automation can materially enhance risk-adjusted returns while maintaining asset security.

What are your thoughts on performance optimization in digital assets?"

---

### Explaining Complex Concepts

**Structure:**
1. Start with why it matters
2. Explain simply
3. Add detail gradually
4. Use analogies if helpful
5. Provide examples

**Example Topic: Algorithmic Optimization**

"Your assets should work as hard as you do. Here's how algorithmic optimization makes that happen.

Traditional investing means buying an asset and holding it. Algorithmic optimization means your asset automatically adjusts based on market conditions‚Äîrebalancing, compounding, optimizing for better returns.

Think of it like a thermostat for your investments. Instead of manually adjusting temperature, the thermostat monitors conditions and adjusts automatically to keep you comfortable. Our algorithms do the same for your assets, continuously optimizing for performance.

Here's what that looks like in practice: [specific example]"

---

### Handling Uncertainty

**Be honest about what you don't know:**

‚ùå "Our technology will revolutionize finance."
‚úÖ "Early results are promising. We're continuing to test across broader conditions."

‚ùå "This guarantees 15% returns."
‚úÖ "Our algorithms target optimal risk-adjusted returns. Past performance doesn't guarantee future results."

**Frame research findings appropriately:**
- "Our data suggests..."
- "Initial findings indicate..."
- "This provides evidence for..."
- "We observe patterns of..."

---

### Talking About Competition

**Focus on our approach, not competitors:**

‚ùå "Unlike [competitor], we actually optimize assets."
‚úÖ "We focus on performance optimization, not just tokenization."

**Acknowledge the category:**
"Many companies are tokenizing assets. We're taking the next step‚Äîmaking those assets perform better through algorithmic optimization."

**Never:**
- Name competitors directly
- Make claims about their work
- Engage in comparison battles

---

## What to Avoid

### Jargon & Buzzwords

**Avoid without definition:**
- Disruptive
- Revolutionary
- Game-changing
- Paradigm shift
- Synergy
- Circle back
- Move the needle
- Low-hanging fruit

**These are fine (they're specific):**
- Algorithmic optimization
- Risk-adjusted returns
- Smart contracts
- Tokenization
- Multi-jurisdictional compliance

---

### Hype & Exaggeration

**Don't:**
- "Revolutionary breakthrough in finance!!!"
- "The world's first/best/only..."
- "Everyone will use this"
- "This changes everything"
- Multiple exclamation points!!!

**Do:**
- "New approach to asset optimization"
- "Early evidence suggests..."
- "Growing adoption among..."
- "Measurable improvements in..."
- One period per sentence.

---

### False Urgency

**Don't:**
- "Act now before it's too late!"
- "Limited time only!"
- "Don't miss out!"
- "Last chance!"

**Do:**
- "Join the waitlist"
- "Early access available"
- "We're launching soon"
- "Be among the first"

---

### Vague Claims

**Don't:**
- "We're changing the world"
- "Better returns" (better than what?)
- "Advanced technology" (what makes it advanced?)
- "Innovative solutions" (innovative how?)

**Do:**
- "We're building performance optimization for real-world assets"
- "4.6-8.2% additional annual returns vs passive holdings"
- "Algorithmic rebalancing using machine learning"
- "Performance RWAs‚Äîassets that optimize themselves"
