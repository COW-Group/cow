## Brand Personality (Four Pillars)

### 1. Zen Minimalism
Clarity through simplicity. Strip away complexity to reveal truth. Every element serves a purpose.

### 2. Playful Wisdom (Grandmother from Mulan)
Serious work, delivered with warmth. Irreverent about conventions, reverent about impact.

### 3. Hopeful Action (Jane Goodall)
Grounded optimism based on evidence. Every small action compounds into transformation.

### 4. Disciplined Rigor (Anthropic/Stanford)
Academic credibility meets commercial execution. Show, don't tell.

## Voice Attributes

**Rigorous but Accessible:** Complex ideas, clearly explained  
**Confident but Humble:** Strong work, honest about limits  
**Warm but Professional:** Human touch, serious infrastructure  
**Direct but Kind:** Get to the point, maintain warmth

---

## Brand Archetype

**The Sage × The Magician × The Explorer**

A rare tri-archetype that defines our unique position:

- **Sage:** Truth-seeking research, rigorous methodology, knowledge-sharing → *"We study deeply"*
- **Magician:** Transforming passive assets into performers, making impossible accessible → *"We transform possibilities"*
- **Explorer:** Pioneering new category, charting uncharted territory, discovery-driven → *"We pioneer new territories"*

**Together:** "We're pioneering Performance RWAs (Explorer) through rigorous research (Sage) that transforms access to wealth (Magician)."

---

## Visual Identity

### Design Philosophy: Sumi-e Sky + Earth
**"Where cyan sky meets earth, life grows - zen minimalism with natural warmth."**

Our visual identity draws from East Asian ink painting (sumi-e) tradition:
- **Cyan Sky/Water**: Aspiration, flow, innovation (brand signature)
- **Earth Tones**: Foundation, stability, warmth (grounding)
- **Life/Growth**: Bamboo and emerald between sky and earth

**The Horizon Principle:**
Every design shows the relationship between sky (cyan) and earth (warm tones). Never floating, always grounded. Creates balance, warmth, and meaning.

**Core Elements:**
- **Three Layers**: Atmospheric (60-70%), Structural (20-30%), Emphasis (5-10%)
- **Mode Parity**: Light = ink on rice paper, Dark = luminous ink in night sky
- **Zen Space**: 60%+ breathing room for contemplation
- **Temperature Balance**: Cool cyan + warm earth = complete
- **Natural Warmth**: Earth tones prevent sterile tech feel

## Key Differentiators

| Others | COW Group |
|--------|-----------|
| Tokenization focus | Performance focus |

## What We Never Say

❌ "Values-aligned" (let work speak)  
❌ Claims without citations  
❌ Metrics we haven't achieved

## Quick Brand Check

**Before launching anything, ask:**

1. **Sound:** Rigorous, warm, clear, inviting?
2. **Look:** Clear luminance hierarchy? Earth-tone warmth present?
3. **Values:** Demonstrates (not states) our values?
4. **Quality:** Research-backed, user-centric, honest?
5. **Mode:** Works in both dark and light modes?

**All yes? → Go!**

---

## Design Testing Framework

**Luminance Hierarchy Test:**
- Can you identify primary → secondary → tertiary information in 3 seconds?
- Does visual weight match information priority?

**Accessibility Test:**
- All text meets WCAG AAA standards (7:1 ratio)?
- Interactive elements clearly distinguishable?

**Warmth Test:**
- Earth tones present (10-15% dark / 20-30% light)?
- Approachable while professional?

**Mode Test:**
- Works in both dark and light modes?
- Illustrations optimized for target background?
