## Content Principles

### What Guides Our Content

**1. Research First**
Never publish claims without backing. If we don't have research, we create it or we don't make the claim.

**2. Education Over Promotion**
Every piece should teach something valuable, even if it's about our products.

**3. Transparency Always**
Share methodology, acknowledge limitations, be honest about progress.

**4. User-Centric**
Write for the reader's benefit, not our own. Answer their questions, not our agenda.

**5. Quality Over Quantity**
One excellent research paper beats ten mediocre blog posts.

**6. Accessibility**
Make sophisticated concepts understandable without dumbing them down.

**7. Long-Term Thinking**
Create evergreen content that compounds in value over time.

**8. Community Building**
Invite conversation, acknowledge others' work, build on collective knowledge.

---

## Content Don'ts

**Never:**
- ❌ Make unverifiable claims
- ❌ Copy competitor content
- ❌ Use clickbait headlines
- ❌ Hide behind jargon
- ❌ Overpromise results
- ❌ Ignore questions or criticism
- ❌ Publish without review
- ❌ Chase trends without relevance
- ❌ Prioritize quantity over quality
- ❌ Forget to cite sources

---

## Special Content Guidelines

### Talking About Values

**Remember:** Values are demonstrated, never stated explicitly.

**Don't say:**
- "We care about sustainability"
- "We're committed to impact"
- "Our values-aligned approach"

**Do show:**
- Research on long-duration asset performance
- Studies on full-cycle economics
- Analysis of wealth distribution patterns
- Examination of systemic stability

The values are obvious from what we choose to study and build.

---

### Handling Criticism

**When someone criticizes our work:**

1. **Thank them** for the feedback
2. **Engage substantively** with the critique
3. **Acknowledge** if they have a point
4. **Clarify** if there's misunderstanding
5. **Improve** if they're right
6. **Stand firm** if we disagree (with respect)

**Example:**
"Thanks for this feedback. You raise an important point about [specific concern]. We designed our methodology this way because [reason], but we appreciate you pushing us to explain this more clearly. We'll update the paper to address this in the discussion section."

---

### Announcing Delays or Issues

**Be transparent and proactive:**

1. **State the issue** clearly
2. **Explain what happened** (if appropriate)
3. **Share the plan** to address it
4. **Give timeline** if possible
5. **Maintain availability** for questions

**Example:**
"We're delaying the launch of [feature] by three weeks. During testing, we found an optimization issue that needs addressing. We'd rather launch it right than launch it fast. New expected launch: [date]. Questions? Email us at [contact]."

---

## Visual Content Guidelines

### For Light and Dark Mode

**All visual content should consider both modes:**

**Light Mode Visuals:**
- Clean white or cream backgrounds
- Deep blue ink (#1e40af, #2563eb)
- High contrast for readability
- Professional, paper-like aesthetic

**Dark Mode Visuals:**
- Deep cosmic backgrounds (#020617, #0f172a)
- Luminous blue ink (#3b82f6, #60a5fa)
- Glowing effect on key elements
- Modern, immersive aesthetic

**Universal Elements:**
- Emerald green (#059669 light / #10b981 dark) for success
- Gold (#b45309 light / #fbbf24 dark) for premium
- Consistent typography
- Same composition and layout

### Creating Diagrams and Infographics

**Process:**
1. Design in light mode first (easier to review)
2. Create dark mode version with adjusted colors
3. Test both modes on actual devices
4. Ensure text is readable in both
5. Use SVG format when possible for crispness

**Color Usage in Diagrams:**
- Primary data: Blue (#2563eb light / #60a5fa dark)
- Secondary data: Emerald (#059669 light / #10b981 dark)
- Tertiary data: Gold (#d97706 light / #fbbf24 dark)
- Text: High contrast in both modes
