---

## Writing Guidelines

### Sentence Structure

**Keep sentences short and clear:**
- Average 15-20 words per sentence
- One idea per sentence
- Vary length for rhythm
- Break up long paragraphs

**Example:**

‚ùå **Too Long:**
"We've developed an algorithmic optimization framework that leverages machine learning and real-time market data to dynamically rebalance portfolios across multiple asset classes while maintaining regulatory compliance and minimizing transaction costs."

‚úÖ **Better:**
"Our algorithms optimize portfolios in real-time using machine learning and market data. They rebalance across asset classes while staying compliant and minimizing costs."

---

### Word Choice

**Use simple, precise words:**

| Instead of | Use |
|------------|-----|
| Utilize | Use |
| Facilitate | Enable, help |
| Implement | Do, build |
| Leverage | Use |
| Paradigm | Model, approach |
| Synergy | Combination |
| Stakeholders | Investors, users, people |
| Solutions | Products, programs |
| Ecosystem | System, network |

**But keep technical terms when appropriate:**
- Algorithmic optimization ‚úì
- Risk-adjusted returns ‚úì
- Multi-jurisdictional compliance ‚úì
- Tokenomics ‚úì

Define terms on first use if not common knowledge.

---

### Active vs. Passive Voice

**Prefer active voice:**

‚ùå Passive: "Performance improvements were observed in optimized portfolios."
‚úÖ Active: "Optimized portfolios showed performance improvements."

**Passive is okay when:**
- Focus is on the action, not the actor
- Actor is unknown or unimportant
- In academic/research writing conventions

---

### First, Second, Third Person

**Default to second person for direct communication:**
- "You can access..." (not "Users can access...")
- "Your portfolio..." (not "The portfolio...")

**Use first person for brand voice:**
- "We're building..." (not "COW Group is building...")
- "Our research shows..." (not "The research shows...")

**Use third person in research:**
- "This study examines..."
- "The data suggests..."

---

### Numbers & Data

**Make numbers scannable:**
- Use numerals, not words (12, not twelve)
- Add commas for thousands (1,000 not 1000)
- Use % symbol (25% not 25 percent)
- Round appropriately (4.6% not 4.6284%)

**Provide context:**

‚ùå "8.2% alpha generation"
‚úÖ "8.2% additional annual returns compared to passive holdings"

**Use data visualizations when possible:**
- Charts for trends
- Tables for comparisons
- Infographics for processes

---

## Common Scenarios

### Announcing Research

**Structure:**
1. Lead with the finding
2. Explain the significance
3. Link to full paper
4. Invite discussion

**Example:**
"New research: Algorithmic asset optimization delivers 4.6-8.2% additional annual returns across 400,000+ wallets in 23 jurisdictions.

This suggests that smart contract automation can materially enhance risk-adjusted returns while maintaining asset security.

Read the full paper: [link]

What are your thoughts on performance optimization in digital assets?"

---

### Explaining Complex Concepts

**Structure:**
1. Start with why it matters
2. Explain simply
3. Add detail gradually
4. Use analogies if helpful
5. Provide examples

**Example Topic: Algorithmic Optimization**

"Your assets should work as hard as you do. Here's how algorithmic optimization makes that happen.

Traditional investing means buying an asset and holding it. Algorithmic optimization means your asset automatically adjusts based on market conditions‚Äîrebalancing, compounding, optimizing for better returns.

Think of it like a thermostat for your investments. Instead of manually adjusting temperature, the thermostat monitors conditions and adjusts automatically to keep you comfortable. Our algorithms do the same for your assets, continuously optimizing for performance.

Here's what that looks like in practice: [specific example]"

---

### Handling Uncertainty

**Be honest about what you don't know:**

‚ùå "Our technology will revolutionize finance."
‚úÖ "Early results are promising. We're continuing to test across broader conditions."

‚ùå "This guarantees 15% returns."
‚úÖ "Our algorithms target optimal risk-adjusted returns. Past performance doesn't guarantee future results."

**Frame research findings appropriately:**
- "Our data suggests..."
- "Initial findings indicate..."
- "This provides evidence for..."
- "We observe patterns of..."

---

### Talking About Competition

**Focus on our approach, not competitors:**

‚ùå "Unlike [competitor], we actually optimize assets."
‚úÖ "We focus on performance optimization, not just tokenization."

**Acknowledge the category:**
"Many companies are tokenizing assets. We're taking the next step‚Äîmaking those assets perform better through algorithmic optimization."

**Never:**
- Name competitors directly
- Make claims about their work
- Engage in comparison battles

---

## What to Avoid

### Jargon & Buzzwords

**Avoid without definition:**
- Disruptive
- Revolutionary
- Game-changing
- Paradigm shift
- Synergy
- Circle back
- Move the needle
- Low-hanging fruit

**These are fine (they're specific):**
- Algorithmic optimization
- Risk-adjusted returns
- Smart contracts
- Tokenization
- Multi-jurisdictional compliance

---

### Hype & Exaggeration

**Don't:**
- "Revolutionary breakthrough in finance!!!"
- "The world's first/best/only..."
- "Everyone will use this"
- "This changes everything"
- Multiple exclamation points!!!

**Do:**
- "New approach to asset optimization"
- "Early evidence suggests..."
- "Growing adoption among..."
- "Measurable improvements in..."
- One period per sentence.

---

### False Urgency

**Don't:**
- "Act now before it's too late!"
- "Limited time only!"
- "Don't miss out!"
- "Last chance!"

**Do:**
- "Join the waitlist"
- "Early access available"
- "We're launching soon"
- "Be among the first"

---

### Vague Claims

**Don't:**
- "We're changing the world"
- "Better returns" (better than what?)
- "Advanced technology" (what makes it advanced?)
- "Innovative solutions" (innovative how?)

**Do:**
- "We're building performance optimization for real-world assets"
- "4.6-8.2% additional annual returns vs passive holdings"
- "Algorithmic rebalancing using machine learning"
- "Performance RWAs‚Äîassets that optimize themselves"

## Examples in Action

### Research Abstract (Formal)

"This paper examines performance differentials in algorithmically managed real-world asset tokens. Using transaction data from 400,000+ wallets across 23 jurisdictions, we document systematic alpha generation of 4.6-8.2% annually relative to passive holdings. Our findings suggest that smart contract automation can materially enhance risk-adjusted returns while maintaining collateral integrity. We discuss implications for portfolio construction and regulatory frameworks."

---

### Homepage Hero (Aspirational)

"Wealth that works while you live. We're building the performance layer for real-world assets‚Äîbringing institutional-grade optimization to everyone, everywhere. Starting with gold. Expanding to the world."

---

### Social Post (Conversational)

"Interesting pattern in our latest research: Long-horizon investors who use algorithmic optimization show 60% less volatility than manual rebalancers. Patient capital + smart automation = better outcomes. üìä"

---

### Support Email (Helpful)

"Thanks for reaching out. Your verification is processing and should complete within 24 hours. You'll get an email when ready.

Meanwhile, you can explore assets and research in your dashboard. The 'Learn' section has helpful guides on getting started.

Let me know if you have other questions!
Sarah, COW Support"

---

### Error Message (Clear)

"Transaction failed: Insufficient balance. You need $50 more to complete this purchase. Add funds or adjust your amount."

---

### Blog Post Opening (Engaging)

"Asset tokenization is everywhere. But here's what most miss: tokenization alone doesn't improve performance.

We spent 18 months analyzing 400,000 wallets across 23 jurisdictions. The data tells a clear story: algorithmic optimization adds 4.6-8.2% annually compared to passive tokenized holdings.

The difference? Performance engineering. Here's how it works."

---

### Product Description (Clear Value)

**Gold Performance Vault**

"Physical gold, algorithmically optimized. Your gold automatically rebalances across storage locations, lending protocols, and market conditions to maximize risk-adjusted returns while maintaining full collateralization.

**What you get:**
- Fractional gold ownership starting at $10
- Algorithmic optimization for better performance
- Full custody transparency
- Quarterly performance reports

Starting performance: 6.2% average annual returns vs 2.1% for static holdings (18-month backtest)."

---

### Research Finding Tweet (Concise)

"New data: Algorithmic rebalancing reduces volatility by 60% while improving returns 4-8% annually.

Not magic. Just math.

Full paper: [link]"

---

### FAQ Answer (Helpful)

**Q: How is this different from buying gold ETFs?**

"Gold ETFs give you price exposure to gold. We give you physical gold that's actively optimized for performance.

Think of it this way:
- ETF: You own shares tracking gold price
- COW: You own actual gold that works to generate returns

Our gold rebalances across lending, storage, and market conditions to maximize your risk-adjusted returns. ETFs just sit there.

Results: Our gold has delivered 6.2% average returns vs 2.1% for passive holdings over 18 months."
