## ‚ú® The Complete System: "Sumi-e Sky + Earth"

### Philosophy
**"Where cyan sky meets earth, life grows"**

Traditional East Asian ink painting (sumi-e) meets modern digital finance.  
Cyan ink represents sky and water - aspiration and flow.  
Earth tones represent foundation and stability.  
Between them, bamboo and emerald represent life growing from earth toward sky.

## üèîÔ∏è The Horizon Principle (RESTORED!)

**"Where Sky Meets Earth"**

Every design shows the relationship between:
- **Sky/Water (Cyan)** = Aspiration, innovation, flow
- **Earth (Warm tones)** = Foundation, stability, trust
- **Life (Bamboo/Emerald)** = Growth emerging from earth toward sky

**The Rule:**
- ‚ùå Never cyan floating alone on pure white/black
- ‚úÖ Always sky meets earth in visible relationship
- ‚úÖ Minimum 20% earth-tone presence
- ‚úÖ Creates warmth, balance, and meaning

**How to Create Horizons:**
1. **Vertical Horizon:** Sky section above, earth section below
2. **Grounded Elements:** Earth-tone bases under cyan elements  
3. **Earth Containers:** Warm backgrounds framing cyan content
4. **Horizon Lines:** Warm stone dividers between sections

---

## üìê Three Layers (Your Design System)

### 1. Atmospheric (60-70%)
**Lightest - Breathing Room**
- Light Mode: Rice paper, cream, white, sky washes
- Dark Mode: Navy deep, navy medium, cosmos
- Purpose: Zen space, calm, foundation

### 2. Structural (20-30%)
**Medium - Organization & Horizon**
- Light Mode: Cards, soft clay sections, warm stone dividers
- Dark Mode: Elevated cards, subtle earth-tone horizons (15-20% opacity)
- Purpose: Containers, grouping, sky-earth relationship

### 3. Emphasis (5-10%)
**Densest - Focal Points**
- Light Mode: Cerulean headers, emerald/bamboo CTAs, terra cotta accents
- Dark Mode: Bright cyan emphasis, bright emerald life, glowing buttons
- Purpose: Command attention, drive action, vital focus

---

## üé≠ Two Modes, One Philosophy

### Light Mode: Sumi-e Ink on Rice Paper

- **Primary:** Cerulean ink (#00A5CF)
- **Earth:** Terra cotta, soft clay, warm stone (20-30%)

- **Earth:** Warm stone tints (15-20% opacity, subtle horizon)
