## Database Migration Steps

### Required Manual Steps in Supabase:

1. **Run RLS Policies Fix**
   ```bash
   # In Supabase SQL Editor
   # Run: /apps/missions-app/FIX_RLS_POLICIES.sql
   ```

2. **Create Test Users** (via Supabase Auth Dashboard)
   ```
   - admin@test.com (password: Test123!)
   - platform@test.com (password: Test123!)
   - user1@test.com (password: Test123!)
   - user2@test.com (password: Test123!)
   - user3@test.com (password: Test123!)
   ```

3. **Update Seed Data UUIDs**
   ```bash
   # Copy user UUIDs from Supabase Auth
   # Update SEED_DATA.sql with actual UUIDs
   # Run: /apps/missions-app/SEED_DATA.sql
   ```

4. **Enable Email Auth** (Supabase Dashboard)
   ```
   - Go to Authentication > Settings
   - Enable Email provider
   - Configure email templates (optional)
   - Enable "Confirm email" (optional)
   ```

5. **Configure Storage** (for file uploads - pending)
   ```
   - Create storage buckets
   - Set up RLS policies for storage
   ```

## Admin Portal Integration

The admin-portal shares the same infrastructure:

### Shared Resources:
- ✅ Supabase client (`@cow/supabase-client`)
- ✅ Database & RLS policies
- ✅ Permissions service
- ✅ User roles system

### Admin Portal Specific (Recommended):
- [ ] Copy AuthContext to admin-portal
- [ ] Copy ProtectedRoute components
- [ ] Wrap admin routes with `AdminRoute` component
- [ ] Add login page (can reuse missions-app design)
- [ ] Update header with user menu + sign out

---

## Environment Variables

Ensure these are set in `.env.local`:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://spnoztsuvgxrdmkeygdu.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...
```

---

## Next Development Priority

1. **Immediate** - Test authentication flow
   - Create test users in Supabase Auth
   - Run seed data script
   - Test login/signup
   - Verify RLS policies

2. **Short-term** - File upload system
   - Supabase Storage setup
   - Avatar uploads
   - Logo uploads

3. **Medium-term** - Member invitation
   - Email invitation system
   - Invitation workflow
   - Role assignment

4. **Long-term** - Advanced features
   - Billing integration
   - Advanced permissions
   - Audit logging
   - Activity tracking

---

## Known Issues / Notes

1. **Legacy Auth Hook** - There's an existing `useAuth` hook in `/hooks/useAuth.ts` that sets a default dev user. This can be deprecated in favor of the new AuthContext.

2. **Organization Switcher Styling** - Currently uses light theme colors. May need dark theme adjustments to match app theme.

3. **Email Verification** - Email confirmation is optional in Supabase. Consider enabling for production.

4. **Admin Portal** - Needs similar auth integration. Can be done as a separate task.
