## üöÄ NEXT STEPS (In Priority Order)

### Step 1: Deploy Database (15 minutes) ‚≠ê **DO THIS FIRST**

```bash
# Option A: Via Supabase Dashboard
1. Go to https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. Select your COW project
3. Open SQL Editor ‚Üí New Query
4. Copy/paste: cow-investor-platform-schema.sql
5. Click "Run"
6. Copy/paste: migration-add-roles.sql
7. Click "Run"
8. Verify: SELECT * FROM products;
```

### Step 2: Update Supabase Client (1 hour)

Update all apps to use typed database:

```typescript
// Example: COW-Products-Site/lib/supabase.ts
import { createClient } from '@supabase/supabase-js'
import { Database } from '../../../database/types'

export const supabase = createClient<Database>(
  process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL!,
  process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY!
)

// Now get type-safe queries!
const { data } = await supabase
  .from('products')  // ‚úÖ Autocomplete works!
  .select('*')
  .eq('is_active', true)  // ‚úÖ Type-checked!
```

### Step 3: Connect Dashboard to Real Data (Week 1)

Priority order:
1. **Products page** - Display GOLD SWIM and SIRI Z31 from database
2. **Dashboard home** - Show real portfolio data
3. **Cart** - Connect to cart_items table
4. **Checkout** - Create real orders

### Step 4: Build Critical Integrations (Weeks 2-4)

1. **Stripe Payment Processing**
   - Set up Stripe account
   - Install Stripe SDK
   - Build checkout flow
   - Set up webhooks

2. **KYC System**
   - Choose provider (Jumio or Onfido)
   - Build submission form
   - Create review dashboard in Missions App

3. **Email Notifications**
   - Choose provider (SendGrid or Resend)
   - Create templates
   - Set up triggers

---

## üîê SECURITY FEATURES IMPLEMENTED

‚úÖ **Row Level Security (RLS)**
- Users can only access their own data
- Staff can access customer orders and support tickets
- Admins have full platform access

‚úÖ **Authentication Middleware**
- Protected routes require login
- Auto-redirect after authentication
- Session refresh handled automatically

‚úÖ **Audit Logging**
- All sensitive operations logged
- User actions tracked for compliance
- IP address and timestamp captured

‚úÖ **Data Integrity**
- Foreign key constraints
- Check constraints on enums
- Unique constraints on important fields
- Automatic timestamps

---

## üí° KEY INSIGHTS & DECISIONS

### Architecture Decisions
1. **Single Database, Multiple Apps:** All applications share one Supabase database with RLS policies for isolation
2. **Role-Based Access:** Three roles (investor, staff, admin) with progressive permissions
3. **Order Servicing Flow:** Orders created in products-site ‚Üí serviced in missions-app
4. **Support Separation:** Investors use support-center app, staff respond via missions-app

### Route Structure
- **Investor Dashboard:** `/dashboard` (not `/client/dashboard`)
- **All authenticated routes protected** via middleware
- **Auto-redirect to dashboard** after successful login

### Technology Choices
- **Supabase** for database and auth (one integrated solution)
- **@supabase/ssr** for modern server-side rendering
- **TypeScript** for type safety across the stack
- **Next.js middleware** for route protection
