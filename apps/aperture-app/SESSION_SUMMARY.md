## üõ†Ô∏è Manual Steps Required in Supabase

### Storage Setup (High Priority)

1. **Create Storage Buckets:**
   ```
   Go to: Storage > Create bucket

   Bucket 1: avatars
   - Name: avatars
   - Public: false
   - File size limit: 2097152 (2MB)
   - Allowed mime types: image/jpeg,image/png,image/webp

   Bucket 2: organization-logos
   - Name: organization-logos
   - Public: false
   - File size limit: 5242880 (5MB)
   - Allowed mime types: image/jpeg,image/png,image/svg+xml,image/webp
   ```

2. **Run Storage RLS Policies:**
   ```sql
   -- Run: /apps/missions-app/SETUP_STORAGE.sql
   -- (In Supabase SQL Editor)
   ```

3. **Verify Storage Setup:**
   ```sql
   -- Check if buckets exist
   SELECT * FROM storage.buckets WHERE id IN ('avatars', 'organization-logos');

   -- Check storage policies
   SELECT * FROM pg_policies WHERE tablename = 'objects' AND schemaname = 'storage';
   ```
