# Missions App - Product Vision

> **Mission-critical project management for purpose-driven work and tokenized companies**

## üéØ What is Missions App?

Missions App is a **Monday.com-style project management platform** within the Cycles of Wealth (COW) ecosystem. It enables purpose-driven teams and tokenized companies to manage their work through customizable **FlexiBoards** with AI-powered apps.

**NOT about religious missions** - "Missions" refers to **purpose-driven work**, company objectives, and tokenized equity projects.

## üè¢ Who Uses It?

### Primary Users
1. **COW Internal Staff** - Managing tokenization projects, compliance, and operations
2. **Partner Companies** - Tokenized companies (e.g., AuAero, AuSiri) managing their projects
3. **Multi-Tenant Architecture** - Each tokenized company is a separate tenant with isolated data

### User Context

2. **Mobile-responsive** - Always consider laptop + mobile + watch
3. **Multi-tenant isolation** - Never leak data across tenants
4. **Apple aesthetics** - Maintain liquid glass styling
5. **Real-time** - Use Supabase subscriptions for live updates
6. **AI-native** - Integrate Claude/Grok where it adds value
7. **Accessibility** - Keyboard shortcuts, screen reader support

**Start with MVP Phase 1**, then expand incrementally. Each feature should be production-ready before moving to the next.
