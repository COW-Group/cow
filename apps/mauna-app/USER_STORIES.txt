US-307: Trauma-Informed Audio Adaptation

US-309: Parts Work Audio Dialogue
As a user doing Internal Family Systems or parts work, I want the AI to learn about my different parts from journal and therapy notes (the critic, the protector, the wounded child) and create distinct sonic signatures for each part, facilitating dialogue and integration, so that parts work is musically supported.

US-310: Therapy Session Preparation Audio

US-312: Journal Sentiment Analysis Audio Response

US-319: Long-Term Therapeutic Narrative Audio
