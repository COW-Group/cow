## COW Brand Integration

### Visual Design
This app implements COW Group's "Horizon Principle" - cerulean (sky/water) always meets earth (stone/clay):

- **Background**: Gradient from cerulean ice ‚Üí rice paper ‚Üí clay soft
- **Card Header**: Cerulean ice to rice paper gradient
- **Footer**: Warm stone to clay gradient (grounding)
- **Primary Actions**: Deep cerulean (#007BA7)
- **Text**: Ink black on rice paper backgrounds

### Color Palette
- **Cerulean** (#007BA7): Primary brand color, buttons, headers
- **Earth Tones**: Warm stone (#9B8B7E), soft clay (#C9B8A8), terra cotta (#C77A58)
- **Neutrals**: Rice paper (#F5F3F0), ink black (#2C3E50)
- **Accents**: Bamboo green (#6B8E6F), gold (#B8860B)

### Typography
- **Font**: Inter (Google Fonts)
- **Hierarchy**: Clear distinction between headers, body, and labels
- **Accessibility**: WCAG AAA compliant contrast ratios

## Voice Selection

The app uses the same voice selection logic as MyCow app:

- **Moo (Male)**: Automatically selects from available male English voices:
  - Looks for: "male", "david", "daniel", "alex", "fred", "tom", "james", "john", "mark"
  - Falls back to first non-female English voice

- **Moolah (Female)**: Automatically selects from available female English voices:
  - Looks for: "female", "zira", "susan", "samantha", "serena", "victoria", "karen", "hazel"
  - Falls back to first female English voice

Voice selection is browser and OS dependent. Most modern browsers support multiple high-quality voices.
